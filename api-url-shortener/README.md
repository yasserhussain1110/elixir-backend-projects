# URL Shortener Microservice

## Objective

Build a full stack app that is functionally similar to this: https://little-url.herokuapp.com/.

## Requirements

* User Story: I can pass a URL as a parameter and I will receive a shortened URL in the JSON response.

* User Story: If I pass an invalid URL that doesn't follow the valid http://www.example.com format, the JSON response will contain an error instead.

* User Story: When I visit that shortened URL, it will redirect me to my original link.

## Finished Product
See the deployed app here https://elixir-url-shortener.herokuapp.com/

## Notes

To start your Phoenix app:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
